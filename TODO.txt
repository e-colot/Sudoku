divide clearly the graphics part of the rest (so it can be used in other projects)

try each failure scenario (sometimes returns are made without thinking what it implies)

Yoda-type conditions to avoid errors :
	if (NULL == myPtr)
instead of
	if (myPtr == NULL)
(so if '=' is put instead of '==', the compiler will put an error)

Rethink the arguments of some functions in the graphical part
